This code implements a web server following the API agreed upon in CS3 at Caltech.

Running:
- Compile with 'make server'
- Run with './server new_config' (or substitute your own config file)
- Tests can be run with 'make test'

API Details:

- Handlers are all created when the web server starts up, and they stay around for the life of the server.
- All handlers are subclasses of RequestHandler. Details in request-handler.h
- Config passing will be done by map from handler name to path. Example config file in new_config.

Adding New Handlers:

- Create the new handler class as a subclass of RequestHandler
- Add a case for the new handler type in parse_config, found in server_support.cpp
- Add a build target for the new handler in the makefile
- Add any necessary configuration details for the handler to the config file
